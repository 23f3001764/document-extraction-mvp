3. It may be the case where the summation of the sanctioned load of the individual members is
higher than the load sanctioned to the GHS at Single point delivery, the recovery of the fixed
charges from the member shall be done as per the sanctioned load of the individual members.

4. Considering that the summation of individual members’ sanctioned load is 3,000 kW and that
there are two categories of sanctioned load at 4kW and 6kW and the common area load 100 kW,
the fixed charges to be billed to all the individual members having the fixed charge at Rs.50/kW
for 4kW sanctioned load and Rs. 100/kW for 6KW sanctioned load of the GHS in FY 2019-20 as
follows:

Fixed Charges (refer Table 3) 230,274
Total Charges 1,931,128

6. The deficit or surplus in the charges recovered by the GHS from its individual members may be
adjusted in the billing of the individual consumers on a pro-rata basis as per the consumption of
electricity by the individual consumers. In this illustration above, the deficit is Rs. 14,303
(Rs. 1,945,431 — 1,931,128), which may be recovered from the consumers based on the electricity
consumption of such individual members, i.e. over 280,000 kWh (3,00,000 — 15,000 — 5,000).
Refer Table-2. Accordingly, the per unit charge comes to Rs. 0.05/kWh (i.e Rs. 14,303/280,000
kWh)

7. Based on the above, the sample bill of an individual member of the society having consumption
