This book has been revised exhaustively according to the global demands of the students.
Attention has been taken to add minor steps between two unmanageable lines where essential so
that the students can understand the subject matter without mental tire.

A number of questions have been added in this edition besides theoretical portion wherever
necessary in the book. Latest question papers are fully solved and added in their respective units.

Literal errors have also been rectified which have been accounted and have come to our
observation. Ultimately the book is a gift to the students which is now error free and user- friendly.

Constructive suggestions, criticisms from the students and the teachers are always welcome
for the improvement of this book.

mg INTRODUCTION
Calculus is one of the most beautiful intellectual achievements of human being. The mathematical
study of change motion, growth or decay is calculus. One of the most important idea of differential
calculus is derivative which measures the rate of change of a given function. Concept of derivative
is very useful in engineering, science, economics, medicine and computer science.
2
The first order derivative of y denoted by - second order derivative, denoted by 2
3 v x
third order derivative by “4 and so on. Thus by differentiating a function y = f(x), n times,
x
successively, we get the nth order derivative of y denoted by or D"y or y (x). Thus, the process
x
of finding the differential co-efficient of a function again and again is called Successive
Differentiation.

Similarly, y, = #” sin(ax +b) = a" sin [ax+b+™)

4. Product Functions e” sin (bx + c) or e* cos (bx + c)
Consider the function y = e™ sin (bx +c)
y, = eb cos (bx + c) + ae™ sin (bx + c)
= e™ [b cos (bx +c) + a sin (bx + c)]
To rewrite this in the form of sin, put
a=rcos ,b=rsin , we get
y, = e“[rsin cos (bx +c) +r cos __ sin (bx + c)]
y, = re“ sin (bx +c + )
Here, r= Vyq2+4p2 and = = tan(b/a)
Differentiating again w.r.t. x, we get
y, = rae* sin (bx +c + ) + rbe™ cos (bx +c + )
Substituting for a and b, we get
y, = re“.rcos sin (bx +c+ )+re“rsin cos (bx +ct+ )
y, = re*[cos sin (bx +c + )+sin cos (bx +c+ )|
= resin (bxt+ct+ + )
y, = Pe sin (bx + c+ 2 )
Similarly, y, = Pe™ sin (bx +c +3 )
q"
y, = ——esin(bx+c) = r"e™ sin (bx+c+n )

In similar way, we obtain

y, = dx cos(bx +c) = r"e™ cos (bxt+c+n )

7g LEIBNITZ'S* THEOREM
Statement. If u and v be any two functions of x, then
D"(u.v) = "G D" (u).v + "c,D"™"(u). D(v) + "c, D"*(u).D? (v) + .«..
+ "cD" (u).D(0) +... + "cu. D"0_ ...(i)
(U.P.T.U., 2007)
Proof. This theorem will be proved by Mathematical induction.
Now, D(u.v) = D (u).0 + u.D(v) = 'c, D (u).v + 'c, u.D(v) ...(ii)
This shows that the theorem is true for n = 1.
Next, let us suppose that the theorem is true for, n = m from (i), we have
D" (uv) = ™c, D™(u).0 + "c, D™" (u) D (v) + "c, D™*(u) D? (0) + ... + MC,
D™(u) D’ (0) +... + ™c,, u D"(0)
Differentiating w.r. to x, we have
D™! (uv) = me {D™ (wu) v+D™(u) D(v)} +c, {D™(u)D(v) + D™ 1(u)D?(v)}

But from Algebra we know that "c_+ "c= "tc, and "c, = ™'c, = 1

* Gottfried William Leibnitz (1646-1716) was born Leipzig (Germany). He was Newton’s rival in
the invention of calculus. He spent his life in diplomatic service. He exhibited his calculating machine in
1673 to the Royal society. He was linguist and won fame as Sanskrit scholar. The theory of determinants
is said to have originated with him in 1683. The generalization of Binomial theorem into multinomial
theorem is also due to him. His works mostly appeared in the journal ‘Acta eruditorum’ of which he
was editor-in-chief.

+m 1D" "(u) D™*(0)+..4 1 e,,4u D™" (0) ...(iii)
Therefore, the equation (iii) shows that the theorem is true for n = m + 1 also. But from (2)
that the theorem is true for n = 1, therefore, the theorem is true for (n = 1 + 1) ie., n = 2, and so
for n = 2 + 1 = 3, and so on. Hence, the theorem is true for all positive integral value of n.
Example 1. If y'’" + y'/" = 2x, prove that
(x? -1) y,,,+ (n+ 1) xy, + (W- mm’) y, = 0. (U.P.T.U., 2007)

Differentiating both sides equation (ii) w.r.t. x, we obtain
2y,y (x? — 1) + 2xy*, = 2m* yy,
y, ( - 1) + xy,- my = 0
Differentiating n times by Leibnitz's theorem w.r.t. x, we get
D" (y,) - (x? — 1) + "ce, D''y,,-D?°(x? — 1) + "ce, D" 2 y, D? (x? 1) + D" (y,)x + "c, D™" (y,) Dx-n’y,

PARTIAL DIFFERENTIATION
Introduction
Real world can be described in mathematical terms using parametric equations and functions such
as trigonometric functions which describe cyclic, repetitive activity; exponential, logrithmic and
logistic functions which describe growth and decay and polynomial functions which approximate
these and most other functions.
The problems in computer science, statistics, fluid dynamics, economics etc., deal with func-
tions of two or more independent variables.
se FUNCTION OF TWO VARIABLES
If f (x, y) is a unique value for every x and y, then fis said to be a function of the two independent
variables x and y and is denoted by
z= fy
Geometrically the function z = f (x, y) represents a surface.
The graphical representation of function of two variables is shown in Figure 1.1.

<= PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL COEFFICIENTS
The partial derivative of a function of several variables is the ordinary derivative with respect to
any one of the variables whenever, all the remaining variables are held constant. The difference
between partial and ordinary differentiation is that while differentiating (partially) with respect to
one variable, all other variables are treated (temporarily) as constants and in ordinary differentia-
tion no variable taken as constant,
Definition: Let z=f (x, y)
o4
Keeping y constant and varying only x, the partial derivative of z w.r.t. ‘x’ is denoted by ay
and is defined as the limit

Let z = f(x, y) represents the equation of a surface in xyz- Zz
coordinate system. Suppose APB is the curve which a plane
through any point P on the surface || to the xz-plane, cuts. As
point P moves along this curve APB, its coordinates z and x A
vary while y remains constant. The slope of the tangent line at Ht
P to APB represents the rate at which z-changes w.r.t. x. ; ; \

sem HOMOGENEOUS FUNCTION
A polynomial in x and y i.e., a function f (x, y) is said to be homogeneous if all its terms are of
the same degree. Consider a homogeneous polynomial in x and y

Example 1. Verify Euler’s theorem for the function
f(% y) = ax? + 2hxy + by’.
Sol. Here the given function f (x, y) is homogeneous of degree n = 2. Hence the Euler’s
theorem is
x f +Y gf = 2f (7)

Now, we are to prove equation (i) as follows:
